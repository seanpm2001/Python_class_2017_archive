Pong Program Preparation Planning 
We're ready to write our first game! Part of programming is breaking down a problem into smaller pieces that you can solve separately. You then combine these smaller pieces into larger components until you have the whole program put together.
 
For the Pong game, use this planning worksheet to help design your code BEFORE you start writing. Read over all the requirements in the left column. Take a few minutes to think before filling out the rest of the worksheet. The first row is an example. 


Game component
	What's going on?
	What owns the logic?
	What triggers the change?
	What could be tricky?
	Pseudocode
	Players can control paddles with required keys
	Paddle moves up or down
	Paddle sprite
	Press up or down arrow 
Press w or s keys
	When paddle gets to the top or bottom it can't move anymore
	Left paddle
variable: left speed
 
if sprite is hitting top edge of canvas OR hitting bottom edge of canvas then
reverse paddle movement


When up arrow is pressed
If paddle is moving down
stop paddle
else
change direction to up
	Ball begins play at middle of field at start of game and after each point
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 


















	Ball bounces correctly off upper and lower edges of paddles
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 














	Ball increases speed each time it bounces off a paddle
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 














	Score a point for the opponent when the ball touches the left or right edge
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 














	Game ends when one player reaches five points
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 














	Winning player is shown when the game ends
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 












	Players can begin a new game
