## Summary of semester 1

I started my first year of my Python course in 2017 during my Sophomore year of High School. I started in a little bit later into the year, as it took a while to get into this class.

During the first semester, it was all block-based programming, which I had gained a high level of knowledge on by using Scratch. However, during this course, we used 2 other block-based languages that were extremely similar to scratch called [Snap!](https://snap.berkeley.edu/) and [BYOB](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BYOB_(programming_language)&redirect=no).

## The 2nd semester

In my 2nd semester of Python class, we went from Snap!/BYOB to actual Python programming. I did 5 chapters of Python programming on a site called [Edhesive](https://edhesive.com/).

I continued this class up until the end of my Sophomore year. I did another year of Python programming in my Junior year to complete the last 5 chapters.
